## Lessons Learned
This project helped me to advance my thinking how everything that can be represented by numbers can be processed to obatin an amazing results. It helped me to understand how actually CNN architeture works to detect fetures from images and classify them.
During project to parameters tuning and deciding the architeture for CNN was complex task. Maintaining good accuracy yet without overfiting the model was challenging task.
